OOP Assignment 2 
There are 3 gamestates to the game:

GameState 0 Introduction and instructions.

GameState 1  The tower defense part, the main gameplay.

Gamestate 2 The end state achieved when you run out of lives and is equivalent to a gameover.

Can use left and right mouse buttons(both required!) and spacebar(gives new game round) for game.

Only tested for windows and was able to get consistent 80 fps.

NOTE--
Game was originally intended to be a cluedo game but I decided to go with something less complicated in the end.
