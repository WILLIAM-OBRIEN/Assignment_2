OOP Assignment 2 

-----Tower defense explanation-----
-The aim of tower defense is to stop what is spawning on the LEFT to goto somewhere offscreen on the RIGHT.
-You must place your towers along the pathway which will shoot down the LEFT spawning monsters.
-These towers have a limited range so place them near the path.
-There is an increased enemy spawn with each level and they get progressively more health.
-It is best to group up towers together.

There are 3 gamestates to the game:
GameState 0 = Introduction and instructions.

GameState 1 = The tower defense part, the main gameplay.

Gamestate 2 = The end state achieved when you run out of lives and is equivalent to a gameover.

Can use left and right mouse buttons(both required!) and spacebar(gives new game round) for game.

Only tested for windows and was able to get consistent 80 fps.

NOTE--
Game was originally intended to be a cluedo game but I decided to go with something less complicated in the end.
